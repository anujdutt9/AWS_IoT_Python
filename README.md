# AWS_IoT_Python
This repository contains the steps and the code to Access the AWS IoT service using Python3, Paho-MQTT on Windows, Linux/Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi3.                                                                                                                             

Requirements:																   
1. Python 3.4.x																   
2. Paho-MQTT         "pip install paho-mqtt"												   
3. SSL               "sudo apt-get install libssl-dev"

1. Go to Amazon IoT website and follow this Guide "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-sdk-c.html".
2. Click on "Create a Resource".
3. Choose "Create a thing", type a name for the thing, and then choose Create.
4. In addition to a confirmation message, the View thing button will be displayed.
5. Choose View thing to display information about your "thing". Here, thing is the shadow of the device that you want to connect to AWS IoT Service.
6. Choose the Connect a device button to download a key pair and a certificate generated by AWS IoT.
7. On the Connect a device page, select the SDK to use, and then choose Generate certificate and policy. We will use "Embedded C" here.
8. This will generate an X.509 certificate and key pair; activate the X.509 certificate; and create an AWS IoT policy and attach it to the certificate.
9. Next you will get to see the Download Links for the certificates and the keys. Download them all.
10. Choose Confirm & start connecting.
